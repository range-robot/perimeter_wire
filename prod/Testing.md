== sensor pcb ==

Testing a sensor pcb requires
* completely assembled sensor pcb
* PC with linux (set up for build and testing)
* ATMEL ICE Programmer with cable
* USB cable
* PW generator
* multimeter

=== Programming ===

1. Connect ATMEL ICE to pc and sensor pcb
2. Connect USB cable to pc and sensor pcb
3. Run ./firmware/bootloader/scritps/program_bootloader.sh
4. Run ./firmware/sensor/scripts/program_with_bootloader.sh
   If you get error "Device unsupported" bootloader is not running.
   Then disconnect the USB and run the command again within 5 seconds.

=== Testing ===

Disconnect all cables.

1. Set potentiometers (3x) to 100kOhm +- 2kOhm (center position, Pins 1-2. R27: left, bottom, R25/R26: bottom, right)
2. Setup generator wire
   Short connector, 200Ohm, 12V
   Code: 0x1b62 (7010)
   Divider: 4
   Mode. 7
   Loop: Rectangle 800mm x 1400mm, 0,5mmÂ² (generator on long edge)
3. Connect Sensor to pc and start
   $ rosrun perimeter_wire_sensor_driver console -p /dev/ttyACM0 -DS -d 4 -c 7010 -r 0 -F 10 -f 32
4. Position the sensor 60mm above the wire (use spacer!), middle of longe edge, away from generator.
   Stay away from sensor (at least 300mm).
   Check measurements. The position of the inductor must be aligned with the loop.
   | Aligned  | |X|       | |Y|       | |Z|       |
   |----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | L1       | < 0.5     | > 5.0     | 1.0 - 4.0 |
   | L2       | > 5.0     | < 0.5     | 1.0 - 4.0 |
   | L3       | 1.0 - 4.0 | > 5.0     | < 0.5     |
   Write this table to the test protocoll (using real values)



== generator pcb ==

Testing a sensor pcb requires
* completely assembled generator assembly
* PC with linux (set up for build and testing)
* ATMEL ICE Programmer with cable
* USB cable


=== Test and Program ===

The commands require a build environment.

1. Setup power supply current limit to 0.1A. Voltage 1V. Connect to generator power.
   Raise voltage slowly to 12V. Current should stay below 0.01A.
2. Connect ATMEL ICE to pc and generator (programming port)
3. Run ./firmware/bootloader/scripts/program_bootloader.sh
4. Connect USB cable to pc and generator
5. Run ./firmware/generator/scripts/program_with_bootloader.sh
   If you get error "Device unsupported" bootloader is not running.
   Then disconnect the USB and run the command again within 5 seconds.
6. Run
   > rosrun perimeter_wire_generator_driver console -p /dev/ttyACM0 -m 7 -a -b -c 5555 -d 4
   LEDs should light up green. Some output at console.
7. Connect wire between CH1 and short
   Power supply should show current of 0.05A - 0.07A.
   Remove wire
8. Connect wire between CH2 and short
   Power supply should show current of 0.05A - 0.07A.
   Remove wire
9. Program default mode
   > rosrun perimeter_wire_generator_driver console -p /dev/ttyACM0 -m 7 -a -b -c 7010 -d 4 -s
10. Disconnect all cables, then reattach usb cable.
   After 10sec, LEDs should light up green
   > rosrun perimeter_wire_generator_driver console -p /dev/ttyACM0
   Output must contain:
      Channel A:
      Mode:   0x7
      Divider:        4
      Code:   0x1b62
      Channel B:
      Mode:   0x7
      Divider:        4
      Code:   0x1b62
