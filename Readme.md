== Observations ==
 * Robot-Shop and GÃ¶tting use simple sinus signals. Ardumower uses a code and matching algorithm.
 * Robot-Shop uses 1mH, Arudmower 100mH coil.


 == Theory ==

Magnetic field strength for z coil:
k: konstant
x: distance orthogonal to wire
d: distance above ground (to wire)

B=k * x / (d^2 + x^2)

We can use the difference of the absolute signal of two coild to get a 0-crossing signal
For d = 0.4 and coil distance 0.05 we get:
