== Observations ==
 * Robot-Shop and GÃ¶tting use simple sinus signals. Ardumower uses a code and matching algorithm.
 * Robot-Shop uses 1mH, Arudmower 100mH coil.


== Theory ==

Magnetic field strength for z coil:
k: konstant
x: distance orthogonal to wire
d: distance above ground (to wire)

B=k * x / (d^2 + x^2)
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin(arctan(x%2Fd))+*+cos(arctan(x%2Fd))%2Fd

We can use the difference of the absolute signal of two coild to get a 0-crossing signal
For d = 0.4 and coil distance 0.05 we get:
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%7Csin%28arctan%28x%2F0.4%29%29+*+cos%28arctan%28x%2F0.4%29%29%2F0.4%7C+-+%7Csin%28arctan%28%28x-0.05%29%2F0.4%29%29+*+cos%28arctan%28%28x-0.05%29%2F0.4%29%29%2F0.4%7C


== Orientation ==

The hardware is designed to measure a vector in a cartesian coordinate system. However the coil for x is inverted.

Looking at the magnetic field of a loop. We define z > 0 to be inside the loop and when above the loop y > 0 to be forward direction. In that case x > 0 means rotation to the right.

When the pcb is mounted flat on the robot and upper pcb is facing in drive direction orientation is '-xyz'.  When it's upside down (in case) and facing in drive direction orientation is '-x-y-z'. And when its mounted on the front of the robot, with the case / pcb facing in drive direction orientation is '-z-yx'.

== Debugging ==

* Compile using --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
* Run openocd
* Connect using vs code (native-debug)
